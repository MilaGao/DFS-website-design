				<p>Raymond Loewy (November 5, 1893 – July 14, 1986) was a Franco–American industrial designer who achieved fame for the magnitude of his design efforts across a variety of industries. He was recognized for this by Time magazineand featured on its cover on October 31, 1949.</p>
				<p>He spent most of his professional career in the United States, becoming a naturalized citizen in 1938. Among his designs were the Shell, Exxon, TWA and the former BP logos, the Greyhound Scenicruiser bus, Coca-Cola vending
				machines, the Lucky Strike package, Coldspot refrigerators, the Studebaker
				Avanti and Champion, and the Air Force One livery. He was involved with
				numerous railroad designs, including the Pennsylvania Railroad GG1 and S-1
				locomotives, the color scheme and Eagle motif for the first streamliners of the
				Missouri Pacific Railroad and a number of lesser known color scheme and car
				interior designs for other railroads. His career spanned seven decades.</p>
				<p>The press referred to Raymond Loewy as The Man Who Shaped America, The
				Father of Streamlining and The Father of Industrial Design.</p>

				<h3>A Global Presence</h3>
				<p>Raymond Loewy launched his career in industrial design in 1929 when Sigmund Gestetner, a
				British manufacturer of duplicating machines, commissioned him to improve the appearance of a
				mimeograph machine. In three days 28-year-old Loewy designed the shell that was to encase
				Gestetner duplicators for the next 40 years. In the process, he helped launch a profession that has
				changed the look of America.</p>
				<p>The Gestetner duplicator was the first of countless items transformed by streamlining, a
				technique that Loewy is credited with originating. Calling the concept “beauty through function
				and simplification,” Loewy spent over 50 years streamlining everything from postage stamps to
				spacecrafts. His more famous creations include the Lucky Strike cigarette package, the GG1 and
				S1 locomotives, the slenderized Coca-Cola bottle, the John F. Kennedy memorial postage stamp,
				the interior of Saturn I, Saturn V, and Skylab, the Greyhound bus and logo, the Shell International
				logo, the Exxon logo, the U.S. Postal Service emblem, a line of Frigidaire refrigerators, ranges, and
				freezers, and the Studebaker Avanti, Champion and Starliner.</p>
				<p>By 1951, his industrial design firm was so prolific that he was able to claim, “the average person,
				leading a normal life, whether in the country, a village, a city, or a metropolis, is bound to be in
				daily contact with some of the things, services, or structures in which R.L.A [Raymond Loewy
				Associates] was a party during the design or planning stage.”</p>
